### 3. Explanation:

- **Event Listener in `buildDOM`:** The `newChild.addEventListener("click", eventFunction);` attaches the `storeOrContinue` function as a click event listener for each button created.
- **Passing the Event Object:** By default, the event listener passes an `event` object to the handler function (`storeOrContinue`). This object contains useful properties, including `currentTarget.id`, which corresponds to the `id` of the clicked element.
- **Handling the Click in `storeOrContinue`:** Inside `storeOrContinue`, `event.currentTarget.id` gives you the `id` of the clicked button, allowing you to handle the logic accordingly.

With these changes, your buttons will trigger the `storeOrContinue` function correctly, and the function will determine whether "Yes" or "No" was clicked by checking the `id`.
