The reason you don't need parentheses in `loaderInstance.loadData` when passing it to `addEventListener` is because you're referencing the function to be called later, not immediately. Here's why:

1. **Function Reference (without parentheses):**
   - When you write `loaderInstance.loadData`, you're providing a reference to the function, but you're not executing it. This allows `addEventListener` to call `loadData` at the appropriate time (when the event is triggered).
   - This is useful when you're setting up event listeners or passing a function to another function for it to call later.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   settingForm.addEventListener('submit', loaderInstance.loadData);
   ```

   In this case, `addEventListener` stores the function reference and will execute it when the `submit` event occurs.

2. **Function Execution (with parentheses):**
   - When you write `loaderInstance.loadData()`, you're calling the function immediately and returning its result. This would execute the function right away, which is not what you want in the context of event listeners.
   - If you did this inside `addEventListener`, the function would execute immediately when the code is read, and you wouldn't have a function available to be called later when the event actually occurs.

   Example (incorrect usage for event listeners):
   ```javascript
   settingForm.addEventListener('submit', loaderInstance.loadData()); // This calls the function immediately, not on event trigger
   ```

### In the `questionManager` Case
In your `prepareJSON` code, you're working with a function that needs to be called immediately (after the data is loaded). That's why you need parentheses when calling `questionInstance.newQuestion()`â€”because you want to **invoke** the function at that point in time, not just pass a reference to be used later.

### Key Difference:
- **Without parentheses**: You are passing a **reference** to the function so it can be called later (like in an event handler).
- **With parentheses**: You are **calling** the function immediately, executing its code right then and there.

This distinction is important in scenarios like event listeners or callback functions where you need to wait for something to happen before the function is executed.
