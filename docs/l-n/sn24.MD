Great! üéâ Let‚Äôs break it down step by step:

### **Issue Recap**
Your original error was:
```
TypeError: Expected JSON, got application/json; charset=UTF-8
```
This happened because `response.json()` expected **exactly** `"application/json"`, but your server was returning `"application/json; charset=UTF-8"`. Even though both are valid, JavaScript‚Äôs strict check caused an issue.

---

### **Explanation of the Fix**
```js
const contentType = response.headers.get("content-type") || "";
if (!contentType.includes("application/json")) {
  throw new TypeError(`Expected JSON, got ${contentType}`);
}
```

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Get the Content-Type Header**
```js
const contentType = response.headers.get("content-type") || "";
```
- `response.headers.get("content-type")` retrieves the `Content-Type` header from the server response.
- If the header doesn‚Äôt exist, it defaults to an **empty string** (`""`), preventing errors when checking.

For example:
- If the server responds with `Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8`, `contentType` will be:
  ```js
  "application/json; charset=UTF-8"
  ```
- If the server doesn't send this header at all, `contentType` will be `""` (empty string).

---

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Check If It's JSON**
```js
if (!contentType.includes("application/json")) {
  throw new TypeError(`Expected JSON, got ${contentType}`);
}
```
- Instead of checking for an **exact match** (`=== "application/json"`), we use `.includes("application/json")`.
- This allows variations like `"application/json; charset=UTF-8"` to pass the check.

---

### **Why This Works**
Without this check, your original `response.json()` failed because it was expecting the **exact** string `"application/json"`, but got a slightly different one with extra `; charset=UTF-8`.

By using `.includes("application/json")`, we allow **flexibility** while still ensuring that the response is JSON.

---

### **Final Outcome**
Now, even if your server adds extra encoding details (`charset=UTF-8`), your script correctly identifies the response as JSON and proceeds without errors. üöÄ
