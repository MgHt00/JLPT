The `10` in `parseInt(..., 10)` is called the **radix**. It specifies the base of the numeral system to be used when parsing the string into an integer.

In this case:
- `parseInt(value, 10)` tells JavaScript to interpret the `value` as a **base-10** (decimal) number.
  
For example:
- `parseInt('1010', 10)` will interpret `'1010'` as the decimal number **1010**.
- If you used `parseInt('1010', 2)`, it would interpret `'1010'` as a binary number and return the decimal number **10**.

By providing `10` as the radix, you ensure the string is interpreted as a normal decimal number. If you omit the radix, JavaScript may try to guess the base, which can lead to unexpected behavior, especially for numbers that start with `0` (they may be interpreted as octal/base-8). 

Always specifying the radix is considered a best practice when using `parseInt()`.
