Yes! That line:  

```js
const config = getClearConfig()[mode];
```

is doing **two things at once**:  

1. **Calling `getClearConfig()`**, which **returns an object**.  
2. **Using `[mode]`** to access a **specific key** inside that object.  

### **üîç Breakdown**
If `mode = "light"`, then:  

```js
const config = getClearConfig()["light"];
```

which is the same as:

```js
const config = {
  target: selectors.sectionMessage
};
```

If `mode = "deep"`, then:

```js
const config = getClearConfig()["deep"];
```

which becomes:

```js
const config = {
  target: [selectors.sectionStatus, selectors.sectionQuestion, selectors.sectionMessage, selectors.sectionAnswer]
};
```

### **üí° Why This Works in One Line**
- `getClearConfig()` **returns an object** `{ light: {...}, deep: {...} }`.  
- `[mode]` **grabs the right key** based on the value of `mode`.  
- `config` is then **assigned the value of that key**.  

---

### **üî• Alternative (More Explicit)**
If you want to separate the steps to see it clearly:

```js
const clearConfig = getClearConfig(); // Step 1: Get the object
const config = clearConfig[mode];     // Step 2: Access the right key
```

But since this is unnecessary, the **one-liner** is cleaner. üöÄ
