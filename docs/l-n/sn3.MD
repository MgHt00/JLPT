### 1. **Attribute Selector `[attr^="value"]`:**
- The square brackets `[]` are part of a CSS selector that allows you to select elements based on their attributes. 
- The `^=` is an attribute selector that means "starts with." So `[id^="answer-btn"]` means "select elements whose `id` attribute starts with `answer-btn`."

### 2. **Wrapping in Quotes `'...'`:**
- In JavaScript, when you use `document.querySelectorAll()` or `document.querySelector()`, you pass a CSS selector as a string. 
- The quotes `' '` around `[id^="answer-btn"]` indicate that it is a string. You could also use double quotes `" "` if you prefer.

### Why it needs to be written like this:
- **`[ ]`**: These square brackets are necessary because you're using an attribute selector. Without them, JavaScript would not recognize it as an attribute-based selector and it would not work.
- **`' '`**: The string quotes are required in JavaScript to denote that you are passing a string (which is the CSS selector) to the function.

### Example:
- **CSS Selector**: `[id^="answer-btn"]` â€” This is a CSS selector that matches any element with an `id` that starts with `"answer-btn"`.
- **JavaScript**: When passing the selector to `document.querySelectorAll`, you need to wrap it in quotes: 
  ```javascript
  document.querySelectorAll('[id^="answer-btn"]');
  ```

This tells JavaScript, "I want to select all elements where the `id` attribute starts with `answer-btn`."

### Analogy:
Think of it like calling a friend (function) and giving them an address (selector) written on a piece of paper (string). The square brackets `[ ]` indicate that you're specifying part of the address (an attribute), and the quotes `' '` are the piece of paper that the address is written on.

I hope this clarifies things!
