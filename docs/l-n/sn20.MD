``` javascript
appState.randomYesNo = selectors.readRandomYesNo === 'true';
    console.info("appState.randomYesNo: ",appState.randomYesNo);

    appState.flashYesNo = selectors.readFlashYesNo === 'true';
    console.info("appState.flashYesNo: ", appState.flashYesNo);
```

Can i update the above mentioned code with followings:

``` javascript
convertToBoolean(selectors.readRandomYesNo, selectors.readFlashYesNo);

function convertToBoolean(...selectorList) {
    console.groupCollapsed("convertToBoolean()");
    // Convert the string values "true"/"false" to boolean values [sn16]

    if selectorList.length === 0 {
      console.error("No value to convert to boolean");
    }

    else {
      for (let selector in selectorList) {
        appState.selector = selectors.selector === 'true';
        console.info(`appState.${selector}: `,appState.selector);
      }
    }
console.groupEnd();
    return this;
  }
```

Your goal of using `convertToBoolean` to refactor and reduce repetition is a great idea, but there are a few issues in the code:

1. **Dynamic property names**: You can't access `appState.selector` dynamically like this; you'd need to use bracket notation to reference the keys dynamically.
2. **`for...in` loop on an array**: `for...in` loops over keys (index positions) of an array, but what you likely want is `for...of` to loop over the array values.
3. **Updating state in `appState`**: The code should update specific properties in `appState`, so you can't hardcode `selector` in `appState.selector`.

Here's an updated version of your function to handle these issues:

```javascript
convertToBoolean(['randomYesNo', 'flashYesNo']);

function convertToBoolean(selectorNames) {
  console.groupCollapsed("convertToBoolean()");
  
  if (selectorNames.length === 0) {
    console.error("No values to convert to boolean");
    return;
  }

  for (let selectorName of selectorNames) {
    // Convert and assign the boolean value
    appState[selectorName] = selectors[`read${capitalizeFirstLetter(selectorName)}`] === 'true';
    console.info(`appState.${selectorName}: `, appState[selectorName]);
  }
  
  console.groupEnd();
  return this;
}

function capitalizeFirstLetter(string) {
  return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1);
}
```

### Key Points:
- **Dynamic Property Access**: We use `appState[selectorName]` to dynamically update the `appState` object.
- **Handling Multiple Properties**: You pass an array of property names (e.g., `['randomYesNo', 'flashYesNo']`), and the function iterates over them.
- **Capitalization Helper**: Since your selectors start with `read`, I added `capitalizeFirstLetter()` to capitalize the first letter of each `selectorName` when accessing the `selectors` object.

This way, you can easily extend the function to convert and update any boolean properties!

<em>I don't understand why we need to use this?  And I don't understand the code inside it as well.  Can you explain it to me?</em>

Let me break down the function `capitalizeFirstLetter` and why it is needed.

### Purpose of `capitalizeFirstLetter()`
The function is used to ensure that the first letter of a string is capitalized. This is important because in your original code, the properties of the `selectors` object (e.g., `selectors.readRandomYesNo`) start with "read" followed by a capitalized word (like `RandomYesNo`). To access these properties dynamically, we need to match the capitalization format.

### Explanation of the code
```javascript
function capitalizeFirstLetter(string) {
  return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1);
}
```

This function takes a string as input and returns a new string where the first letter is capitalized. Here's how it works step by step:

1. **`string.charAt(0)`**: 
   - This gets the first character of the string (at position `0`).
   - For example, if `string = 'randomYesNo'`, `charAt(0)` will return `'r'`.

2. **`.toUpperCase()`**: 
   - This converts the first character (the one we just selected with `charAt(0)`) to an uppercase letter.
   - So if `charAt(0)` was `'r'`, after `toUpperCase()`, it becomes `'R'`.

3. **`string.slice(1)`**: 
   - This takes the rest of the string starting from position `1` (i.e., everything except the first character).
   - So if `string = 'randomYesNo'`, `slice(1)` will return `'andomYesNo'`.

4. **`+` (concatenation)**:
   - We concatenate the capitalized first letter (`'R'`) with the rest of the string (`'andomYesNo'`), resulting in `'RandomYesNo'`.

### Why we need this function
When you're dynamically building property names like `selectors.readRandomYesNo`, the "RandomYesNo" part must start with a capital letter. If you pass `'randomYesNo'`, you need to capitalize the first letter to form `selectors.readRandomYesNo`.

For example:
- You have a property called `selectors.readRandomYesNo`.
- You want to access it dynamically based on the word `'randomYesNo'`.
- To match the property format, you need to turn `'randomYesNo'` into `'RandomYesNo'`, which is why we use `capitalizeFirstLetter`.

### In Action:
When you call this:
```javascript
capitalizeFirstLetter('randomYesNo');
```
It returns `'RandomYesNo'`. 

Now, in the dynamic property access:
```javascript
selectors[`read${capitalizeFirstLetter(selectorName)}`];
```
This evaluates to:
```javascript
selectors[`readRandomYesNo`];
```

That's how the function ensures you can access the correct property name in your code.

---

### Summary:
The `capitalizeFirstLetter()` function is needed to correctly access properties of the `selectors` object by ensuring that the first letter after "read" is capitalized. Without it, your code wouldnâ€™t correctly match the property names, like `selectors.readRandomYesNo`.

Would you like further clarification, or does this make sense now?

<em>So if i pass the argument with the capital first letter, like convertToBoolean(['RandomYesNo', 'FlashYesNo']); I would not need to use capitalizeFirstLetter().  Am I understand correctly?</em>

Yes, you understand correctly!

If you pass arguments that already have the first letter capitalized (like `['RandomYesNo', 'FlashYesNo']`), you **would not need** the `capitalizeFirstLetter()` function, because the capitalization is already correct.

For example:
```javascript
convertToBoolean(['RandomYesNo', 'FlashYesNo']);
```

In this case, the `capitalizeFirstLetter()` function becomes unnecessary because the input is already in the correct format for accessing properties like `selectors.readRandomYesNo` and `selectors.readFlashYesNo`.

You can directly use the input without needing to transform it, as long as the property names match exactly with what you're trying to access.

Would you like help adjusting your function to skip the capitalization if your inputs are already in the correct format?
