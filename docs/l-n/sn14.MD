The issue might be related to how you're passing the selected elements to the `flipNodeState()` function. Specifically, if you're using `document.querySelectorAll()`, it returns a `NodeList`, and `flipNodeState()` expects individual DOM elements, not a `NodeList` or array.

Here’s how you can fix this:

### Solution 1: Spread the NodeList when calling `flipNodeState()`

If you’re using `querySelectorAll()`, spread the `NodeList` into individual elements when passing them to `flipNodeState()`:

```javascript
const noOfAnsSelectors = document.querySelectorAll("[id^=noOfAnswers]");
flipNodeState(...noOfAnsSelectors); // Spread operator to pass individual nodes
```

This way, each radio button element will be passed to `flipNodeState()` as a separate argument, making the `forEach()` loop inside the function work correctly.

### Solution 2: Ensure you're working with individual elements

If you only want to pass one element (the first one found by `querySelector()`), make sure you’re using the correct selector:

```javascript
const noOfAnsSelector = document.querySelector("[id^=noOfAnswers]");
flipNodeState(noOfAnsSelector); // Only the first matched element
```

### Explanation

- `document.querySelectorAll()` returns a `NodeList`, which is a collection of elements. If you pass it directly to a function expecting individual elements, it won’t work as expected.
- By using the spread operator `...`, you break down the `NodeList` into individual DOM elements, allowing the function to handle them correctly.

If you still run into issues, try logging out the `nodes` array inside the `flipNodeState()` function to ensure that the correct elements are being passed.
