If you've already declared constants for the elements at the top of your script, you can modify the `flipNodeState()` function to work directly with the already declared constants rather than passing them as string selectors.

In this case, you don't need to query the DOM again. Instead, you can pass the constants (which are the DOM elements) directly to the function.

Hereâ€™s how you can modify the `flipNodeState()` function to accept those constants directly:

### Updated `flipNodeState()` function:

```javascript
function flipNodeState(...nodes) {
  // Iterate over the nodes and toggle the disabled state
  nodes.forEach(node => {
    if (node instanceof HTMLElement) {
      node.disabled = !node.disabled;
    }
  });
}
```

### Explanation:
1. The `...nodes` syntax allows you to pass multiple DOM elements as arguments to the function.
2. Inside the function, it checks if each `node` is an instance of `HTMLElement` and toggles its `disabled` state.

### Usage:

Since you've already declared `aChoiceSelector`, `noOfAnsSelector`, and `submitBtn` at the top, you can call `flipNodeState()` like this:

```javascript
flipNodeState(submitBtn, aChoiceSelector, noOfAnsSelector);
```

This will toggle the `disabled` state of all the passed elements directly.

### Example:
If your declarations look like this:

```javascript
const aChoiceSelector = document.querySelector("#aChoiceInput");
const noOfAnsSelector = document.querySelector("#noOfAnswers");
const submitBtn = document.querySelector("#submit-btn");
```

Then you can call:

```javascript
flipNodeState(submitBtn, aChoiceSelector, noOfAnsSelector);
```

This is more efficient, as you avoid querying the DOM multiple times.

The `instanceof` operator checks if an object is an instance of a specific class or constructor. In this case, `node instanceof HTMLElement` is used to determine whether `node` is a valid HTML element.

### Here's how it works:
1. **`HTMLElement`** is the base class for all HTML elements in the DOM.
2. **`instanceof`** checks whether the object on its left (in this case, `node`) is an instance of the `HTMLElement` class.
   - If the object is an HTML element (like a `div`, `input`, etc.), it returns `true`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `false`.

### Example:

```javascript
const node = document.querySelector('#myElement');

if (node instanceof HTMLElement) {
  console.log('This is a valid HTML element.');
} else {
  console.log('This is not an HTML element.');
}
```

### Why use it?
If you're passing different types of values (like strings or other objects), using `instanceof HTMLElement` ensures that you're only trying to manipulate valid HTML elements. This prevents errors like trying to access properties (e.g., `disabled`) on something that isn't an element.

### In your case:
When you're passing the constants `submitBtn`, `aChoiceSelector`, etc., the check ensures they're valid elements before trying to modify properties like `disabled`. It helps avoid runtime errors.
