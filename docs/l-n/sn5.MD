Here's a step-by-step guide on how to store incorrect answers using `localStorage`:

### Step 1: Understand `localStorage`
`localStorage` is a way to store key-value pairs in the browser. It persists across browser sessions, meaning that even if the user closes and reopens the browser, the data will still be there unless itâ€™s manually cleared.

### Step 2: Store Incorrect Answers in `localStorage`
When the user clicks "No" (indicating they got the answer wrong), you can store the current question and answer in `localStorage`.

#### Example Code:
```javascript
function storeOrContinue(event) { // sn4
  const btnID = event.currentTarget.id;

  if (btnID === "choice-btn-0") {
    console.log("Yeah, will store.");
    // Handle "Yes" logic here
  } else if (btnID === "choice-btn-1") {
    console.log("No, let's continue.");
    
    // Handle "No" logic: Store the question in localStorage
    let incorrectAnswers = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("toPractice")) || [];
    incorrectAnswers.push(questionObj);
    localStorage.setItem("toPractice", JSON.stringify(incorrectAnswers));
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Retrieve Data from `localStorage`
When you want to retrieve the stored incorrect answers, you can use the following code:

```javascript
function loadIncorrectAnswers() {
  let incorrectAnswers = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("toPractice")) || [];
  console.log(incorrectAnswers);
  // You can use the `incorrectAnswers` array for further processing
}
```

### Step 4: Clear Data from `localStorage`
If you want to clear the stored incorrect answers, you can use:

```javascript
function clearIncorrectAnswers() {
  localStorage.removeItem("toPractice");
}
```

### Step 5: Integrate with Your Application
You can now integrate these functions into your app, allowing users to store and review their incorrect answers for future practice.
