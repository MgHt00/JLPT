Great question! The reason we use square brackets when writing `[key, params]` in the `forEach` loop is because of **array destructuring** in JavaScript.

In this case, you're iterating over `Object.entries(ansMapping)`. Here's what happens step-by-step:

1. **`Object.entries(ansMapping)`**: This converts the object `ansMapping` into an array of arrays. Each entry (key-value pair) becomes an array of two elements: the key and the value. For example:
    ```javascript
    Object.entries(ansMapping);
    // Output:
    // [
    //   ['ka', { parent: ..., child: ..., content: ..., className: ..., idName: ... }],
    //   ['hi', { parent: ..., child: ..., content: ..., className: ..., idName: ... }],
    //   ['en', { parent: ..., child: ..., content: ..., className: ..., idName: ... }]
    // ]
    ```

2. **Destructuring**: The `forEach(([key, params]) => {...})` syntax takes each sub-array (like `['ka', { ... }]`) and automatically assigns the first element (the key, like `'ka'`) to `key` and the second element (the value, which is the `params` object) to `params`.

   Without destructuring, you would have to do it manually:
    ```javascript
    Object.entries(ansMapping).forEach(entry => {
      const key = entry[0];    // key would be 'ka', 'hi', or 'en'
      const params = entry[1]; // params would be the object for that key
      // Do something with key and params...
    });
    ```

By using array destructuring (`[key, params]`), it simplifies this process and makes your code cleaner and easier to read. You’re extracting both values directly from the array into two variables in one go.

### Summary
- **`Object.entries(ansMapping)`** gives an array of arrays, where each sub-array contains the key and the value.
- **`[key, params]`** is array destructuring that unpacks the key and value into two separate variables. This way, you can easily use both inside the loop.
